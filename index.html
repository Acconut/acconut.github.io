				<div class="Text">
					tus is an open-source project with the goal of providing resumable uploads for everyone, so unstable connections and unreliable infrastructure do not cause data loss during file transfers. We specify a protocol for file uploads and provide software implementations for all common platforms to make getting started easy. As the project lead, I coordinate the development of new features and I am in constant exchange with the community to assist them with any problems.

		<h2 class="Heading">My Knowledge</h2>
		
		<div class="Text">
			I am firm believer that one should choose the best tool for each task individually. There is not a single best programming language but instead the correct one depends on the specific situation. Therefore, I don't see myself bound to a certain set of programming languages or tools, and I am always eager to acquire new knowledge and extend my toolbox. That being said, on a daily basis I use <b>Go</b>, <b>Node.js</b>, <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>Python</b> running on <b>Linux</b> systems. I am also frequently in contact with <b>Amazon Web Services</b> and other cloud providers.
